              <p>As an actor I am always trying to find the truth of everything
              I say and do onstage. I realize that this is not a new thought,
              but it is one that I have taken for granted lately. It is just
              something I do, not giving much thought to why.</p>


              <p>But one of the many why’s just became so much more clear to
              me. <strong>Truth is imminently watchable.</strong></p>


              <p>I was wondering why so many people like the show Church
              Basement Ladies. (It was running at Wayside Theatre right before
              I started rehearsals for Boeing Boeing.) I am not going to
              pretend that it is a bad show, or that it isn’t art. Because it
              <em>is</em> art, and it <em>is</em> a good show. But I hadn’t
              given any thought to why. The answer is simple. There is a lot of
              truth in it.</p>


              <p>The reason that show does so well with audiences is that they
              see themselves on stage. Or they see people they know. There is a
              kind of familiarity there that is absent from so many other
              shows. It is the characters and the situations they are in that
              is so endearing.</p>


              <p>So what about Shakespeare? It is the same thing, at its core,
              that will make the same audience love Shakespeare that already
              loves Church Basement Ladies. Familiarity. Truth.</p>


              <p>Because we lose so much familiarity in the way of situations
              (and honestly, characters) comparing Church Basement Ladies to
              Shakespeare we <em>must</em> make up for it with pure truth.
              <strong>If an audience sees characters on stage who they may not
              relate to personally but nevertheless believe are real and
              truthful, that becomes so fascinating they don’t care that those
              characters are dealing with situations that they themselves have
              never encountered.</strong> They are thrilled to see this thing
              that seems so real.<em><br></em></p>

            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>This may be a no-brainer for most of the acting world, but
              every once in a while, even the most obvious things take a while
              to sink in.</p>


              <p>I recently added a song to my repertoire that I had heard
              dozens of times, but had never sung myself: “But Not For Me” by
              Gershwin. It never really spoke to me. I was more of a fan of the
              “They All Laughed” type of Gershwin music. I realized that the
              song is so incredibly beautiful and that I <em>never</em> would
              have appreciated it as a younger actor. It is full of some of the
              worst kind of heartache and pain that you just can’t grasp right
              out of college.</p>


              <p>There are so many things that we are asked to experience as
              actors long before we experience them as people. In many cases,
              we hopefully never will experience them. But in the event that we
              do, it is incredibly worthwhile to look at old material or
              previously untouched material with these new eyes.</p>

              <p>Pillowman: Katurian<br>
              Illinois State University, Normal IL 2006</p>


              <p>From director Bob Quinlan “Eddie, it’s time to release into
              the play.”</p>


              <p>I didn’t comprehend what Bob meant when he first offered up
              this masterfully worded piece of advice. It has become a part of
              my process, used in EVERY play that I’ve acted in since. It’s
              quite simple really, release your developed character into the
              world of the play that you and your team have developed
              throughout rehearsal.</p>


              <p>In other words…let go.</p>


              <p>This is fundamental in one’s development as an actor. Break
              down personal walls, humble your pride, exude vulnerability and
              you’ll be ready to start developing a character. To “release into
              the play” is a different matter, though. That comes when the
              character is fully developed. Finding the time to implement this
              idea of releasing can prove to be difficult. Too early and the
              actor enters a underdeveloped world, one where people and places
              aren’t prepared for interaction. Too late and, well, the audience
              gets cheated if you get my drift.</p>


              <p>Side note: Anything less than a FULL release for every moment
              of every scene the character is in does no good. Strive for
              excellence, it will decrease the detriment of your errors.</p>


              <p>Back on track now. A process of trial and error is needed to
              determine when the release works best, varying for each
              individual. Now, many times I will release <em>moments</em> early
              on. This is fine. It’s healthy to recognize. However this isn’t
              releasing into the PLAY. Much work must be done on everyone’s
              part in order for the play to be a safe place for the actor to
              release into. Often times this happens in dress rehearsals
              leading up to opening. When the actor is ready to solidify the
              choices they’ve been testing out in rehearsal. Remember shows
              don’t grow, cancer grows! Shows get more specific.</p>

              of the most important things you can do to increase your skill
              level at anything is to watch people who are good at it. Not just
              watch, but study carefully and absorb.</p>


              <p>The first time that this concept truly hit me (way before I
              read the book mentioned above) was watching <a href=
              "http://geneweygandt.com/" target="_blank" title=
              "Gene&#39;s Site">Gene Weygandt</a> during rehearsals for The

              "Gene&#39;s IBDB Profile">incredibly talented</a> and <a href=

              "Gene&#39;s IMDB Profile">seasoned</a> <a href=
              "http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2010/09/barbara-robertson-gene-weygandt-rejoining-wicked.html"
              target="_blank" title=
              "Chicago Tribune: Weygandt rejoins cast of Wicked">Chicago
              actor</a>. His stage presence is largely unmatched and his acting
              choices are incredibly thoughtful. Or, I assume they are. He
              could just be flying by the seat of his pants, but I doubt
              it.</p>


              <p>During rehearsals, I watched him like a hawk whenever I got
              the opportunity. I learned a lot. But more importantly, I am
              still learning from the movies in my mind of his work. I am
              today, years later, making connections every now and again to
              things I watched him do back then.</p>


              <p>For example, I have recently been thinking a lot about silence
              on stage. When it is effective, when it is detrimental. Length,
              depth, etc. Comedic timing vs. dramatic timing… just timing. One
              of the things I think about is Gene’s incredible moment playing
              Sr. Naccarelli while delivering the line “I have known many
              Americans during the war. Done certain small things for them in,
              how you say… ‘liaison.’” I was amazed at the pause he put before
              the final word of the line. He was really searching for that
              English word that his Italian tongue had not used in years. I
              was, perhaps, the only person intrigued by that moment in the
              show, but because I studied that moment so intensely I have a
              remarkably clear memory of it in my mind. And the timing of that
              line still informs my thoughts and decisions today. But it also
              informs me of something else. The pause wasn’t just dead space.
              During that pause, Gene’s character was visibly
              annoyed/frustrated with himself for not having the word he wants
              right at the tip of his tongue. The journey his character took in
              that 7 seconds or so throughout the entirety of the line was
              visceral. You knew exactly what was going on in his head and felt
              his slight struggle to a) communicate and b) keep up the pace of
              conversation.</p>


              <p>Much of what I have derived from that moment has only happened
              recently, but the fact that I absorbed that moment and observed
              it carefully then is giving me all kinds of benefits now. It
              isn’t just watching or just paying attention. It is <em>active
              observation</em>. Hang on to every millisecond of what you are
              observing. If you have <a href=
              "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JC1RM2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007JC1RM2&linkCode=as2&tag=happycolli-20"
              target="_blank" title="Buy this book on Amazon">The Little Book
              of Talent</a>, re-read Tip #1: Stare at who you want to
              become.</p>


              <p>I think that it is a very worthwhile practice to consciously
              pick someone worth learning from and absorb as much as you can
              from them by simply paying close attention. I believe that this
              can work even if there isn’t someone in your cast who is as
              engrossing as Mr. Weygandt. You would probably do well to even
              study those who are making “mistakes” and capture those mistakes
              in your mind. In the future, you may see a brilliance in them
              that you couldn’t appreciate before, or you may make a connection
              and realize <em>why</em> the choices they made didn’t seem to
              work.</p>

                <p>This piece comes to us from Theresa McGuirk. I am very
                pleased to have an entry of this quality as the first from a
                guest author. The voice of this piece is clearly speaking
                directly to the reader, but don’t let that dissuade you from
                submitting something that comes from a different angle
                altogether. Feel free to copy and paste straight from your
                personal acting journal. One of our upcoming featured authors
                did just that, with a little tidying up for clarity.</p>

                </p>
              </div>


              <p>One of the things I appreciate most as an actor is that moment
              when everything clicks. You know what I mean. That moment when
              you are on stage and all of a sudden, the clouds part and the
              heavens open and the years of intense training come joyfully to
              fruition, and the blood, sweat, and tears endured during the
              rehearsal process are all worth it. That moment where you
              discover something not only about your character, but about
              yourself as well.</p>


              <p>When I was in school, my fellow classmates and I were tasked
              with the wonderful assignment of performing four monologues as
              part of our acting final. Two classic, two contemporary, a
              comedic and dramatic of each. After that ordeal was over, I went
              to my acting teacher for notes on my performance. She said that I
              did a great job with each of the pieces, but the thing that
              concerned her was that they all seemed to have the same IQ. More
              importantly, they all had my IQ.</p>


              <p>“You are a very smart young lady,” she said, “but not every
              character you play is going to be as smart as you.”</p>


              <p>I pondered her words for a long time and they seemed to make
              sense, but it wasn’t until about two years later that that nugget
              of wisdom really hit me.</p>


              <p>I was called in at the last minute to take over a part in a
              show. It was a role that I was actually supposed to play from the
              beginning, but things changed. Anyway, it was really a blessing
              in disguise that things turned out the way they did; not for my
              sanity or the sleep that I lost, but for my growth as an actor.
              If I had had the whole process to over-think things, like I
              normally did, I would probably never have learned the lesson I
              was supposed to learn.</p>


              <p>This was a character that was so far removed from me. <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_Movement_Analysis#Effort"
              target="_blank" title="Laban Movement Analysis">She was a
              floater, I am a wringer</a>. She was very simple with her
              thoughts and I, well, I have never had a simple thought in my
              life. And I had four short days to learn lines, and blocking, and
              when to wear what costume, and oh yeah, how to lower my IQ to be
              this girl who was no where near as smart as I was.</p>


              <p>Somewhere in the middle of the second preview, this gloriously
              bright light bulb went off in my head. It occurred to me, as I
              was delivering the most tripped out monologue about how I wanted
              to be an eagle, that a wall had been broken through. This girl
              wasn’t as smart as me, true, but she wasn’t dumb. No one really
              goes through life thinking that they are dumb. She might not have
              had super complex thoughts, but the thoughts she did have were
              important to her.</p>


              <p>And then it occurred to me that the reason I was always opting
              to play smart, strong women, was because I was scared of the
              vulnerability that came with not seeming invincible. The walls of
              strength and intelligence that I had been hiding behind needed to
              come down.</p>


              <p>I did start to notice, after I came to this realization, that
              a lot of us seem to struggle with finding a happy IQ for our
              characters. One woman I have worked with in the past, a very
              seasoned actress, had such trouble with a character she was
              playing. A character, you could tell, she thought she was much
              smarter than. Rather than embracing this role, she almost seemed
              to be personally commenting on how not smart she thought this
              girl was to the point of mockery, or caricaturization. This led
              to a very lackluster and insincere performance that the audience
              had trouble relating to.</p>


              <p>One of my favorite pastimes is people watching. You learn a
              lot about people and what they think of themselves just by
              observing them. I have found this practice to be incredibly
              helpful when I need some guidance on how to adjust my IQ. If you
              need enlightenment about people, that is the best place to start.
              But don’t do it at Walmart. There are some forms of intelligence
              that should never be observed.</p>

                <p>As the very first post that this site will contain, I must
                admit I don’t want to set the wrong course. This insight that I
                found has little to do with the acting process, but might be
                useful from a directorial standpoint or from the perspective of
                an artistic director. Shame on me for starting out with a bit
                of a tangent, but in reality, it still serves to inform the
                actor, I think. Some things are more indirect, as I feel this
                realization may be.</p>

              <p>Often actors in a show that could be slightly offensive take
              the stance that having people walk out of your performance is a
              sign that you are doing well. I’ve always been slightly put off
              at that sentiment. How could it be good for the theater (venue),
              for the theatre (art form), for the audience, and for the actor
              to offend someone to the point that they walk out on your show?
              The theater loses money (which in turn will make them wary of
              doing that kind of show again), the actor loses a job if the
              theater loses <em>enough</em> money, the theatre loses even more
              ground to less communal entertainment, and the audience loses the
              opportunity to be challenged, changed, or entertained. Yet, I
              also always felt there was a truth buried somewhere in the
              sentiment that “we are doing our job right if people walk
              out.”</p>


              <p>Last night during a conversation about our show with a fellow
              castmate, the words I have been looking for fell out of my mouth
              and I had one of those moments where I connected the dots faster
              than I could comprehend. I spoke the words and in hearing myself
              speak, I found the answer to the question.</p>


              <p>The real victories in theatre that aims to push an audience
              isn’t in the number of people that walk out, but in the number of
              people who <em>almost</em> walk out. Victory is in the people who
              are initially offended enough to notice they are offended, but
              are also entertained enough to stay and see the play through. It
              is those people who are likely to think about what they saw and
              re-evaluate their beliefs. Even if those beliefs don’t change,
              that isn’t important. They are still bettered for having thought
              about something rather than dismiss it entirely.</p>
